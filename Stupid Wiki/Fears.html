    <h3><b><u>What is Fear?</u></b></h3>
    <h4>    Fear is one of the most basic human emotions. <br> It is programmed into the nervous system and works like an instinct. <br> From the time we're infants, we are equipped with the survival instincts necessary to respond with fear when we sense danger or feel unsafe. <br>
        Fear helps protect us. It makes us alert to danger and prepares us to deal with it.  <br>Feeling afraid is very natural — and helpful — in some situations. <br>Fear can be like a warning, a signal that cautions us to be careful. <br>
        Like all emotions, fear can be mild, medium, or intense, depending on the situation and the person. <br>A feeling of fear can be brief or it can last longer.
